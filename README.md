# IBM-Watason-chat-bot
i have made a chat bot for the website which will help the user to know how to use the website.
if you write hi or any welcoming word it will welcome you and give you 3 option:
first one is: "what is this website" if the user choose it it will give him the information of the website.
second one is : "how can i use the website" if the user choose it it will the information of each panel and how to use it.
third one is: "nothing" if the user choose it, it will ask the user if you want anything else say hi to it.
